Mission Statement V1

Problems/Issues: 
Young emerging professionals often face challenges in building a supportive network of like-minded individuals, especially in diverse cultural landscapes like Canada. These individuals, whether recent graduates or new in their careers, may find it difficult to connect with peers who share their goals and aspirations. Additionally, cultural and ethnic differences can further isolate them, as communities may be segregated based on these factors. The lack of a diverse and inclusive network can hinder their professional growth, limit opportunities for collaboration and mentorship, and impede their ability to navigate the complexities of the professional world. 
Leaders of Tomorrow Association aims to bridge these gaps by providing a platform where young professionals from various backgrounds can come together, share experiences, exchange ideas, and support each other's aspirations. By fostering inclusivity and diversity, the association empowers emerging leaders to build meaningful connections, develop valuable skills, and thrive in their careers amidst Canada's multicultural landscape.
